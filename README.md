# RegexGuide
    RegEx is also known as Regular Expression which is a method to define parameters.

## Summary

This is the RegEx or regular expression that I will be explaining in the **tutorial** below. 
In the sections below, there will be details on what the regular expression is and how it is deconstructed. 
The regular expression I will give a tutorial on, will be matching an Email:    `` /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ ``
